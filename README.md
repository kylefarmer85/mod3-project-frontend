Code Yourself (Frontend)
======
Code Yourself is a pure JavaScript SPA where users can create accounts and make posts about coding projects they are working on. Other users can comment to offer help and visit the github repository for the project. Users can "like" posts as well. Fetch requests connect to a RESTful Rails API and SQLite backend.
